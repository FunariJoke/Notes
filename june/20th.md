the syntax stuff item thingies are called data structures
JS is clientside
anything that is text in Javascript is a string
strings are identified using quotation marks ("")
if the string is missing the closing or beginning quote, the engine will inform you that theres a syntaxerror

booleans are true or false statements and are easily recognized within lines of code.  no special syntax is needed

numbers dont require special syntax either, they're identified by the engine aswell

in order to define variables, use var or let
ex: var name = "swag";

functions are pieces of fucntionality that we can use again and again and again
